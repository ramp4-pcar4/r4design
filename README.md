# Obsolete :'D

With the release of the improved github discussions, all items in this repo have migrated to the [RAMP 4 Discussions List](https://github.com/ramp4-pcar4/ramp4-pcar4/discussions).


*Orig content below*

## Why?

We want a place to track our design choices, and allow members not in the immediate discussions to review and chime in at a later date.

Github `Discussions` would be ideal for this, but the feature-set for Issues is currently way better than Discussions (i.e. search-able, condensed list, labels) so we have this repo to act as a separate issue list.
